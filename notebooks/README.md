# Meteorological Dataset Overview

This dataset is a comprehensive record of meteorological parameters over time, with a primary focus on temperature fluctuations. The dataset is organized as time-series data, with each data point corresponding to a specific date and time. The main target variable is temperature, representing the ambient air temperature recorded periodically.

## Data Understanding

We are using Dataset 4, which records comprehensive meteorological parameters over time. The dataset consists of 64,320 rows with records taken every 15 minutes from 2016 to 2018. The features available in this dataset are:

- **Date**: Each data point has a timestamp indicating the date and time of observation. This allows for accurate temporal analysis and correlation with other variables.
- **Iws**: Cumulative wind speed over the period leading up to each observation. Wind speed is a crucial factor influencing temperature dynamics and can provide insights into atmospheric conditions.
- **Ir**: Rainfall intensity measured at each observation time. Rainfall can significantly impact temperature patterns, especially during precipitation events.
- **Pm2.5**: Concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air. PM2.5 levels indicate air quality and can affect temperature by influencing solar radiation absorption and atmospheric stability.
- **PRES**: Atmospheric pressure recorded at each timestamp. Changes in atmospheric pressure can affect temperature, impacting weather systems and air mass movements.
- **Cbwd**: Combined wind direction measured at the observation location. Wind direction can influence temperature patterns, particularly concerning the source region of the air mass.
- **DEWP**: Dew point temperature, representing the temperature at which the air becomes saturated with moisture. Dew point is a critical parameter for understanding humidity levels and can impact perceived temperature and comfort.

## Target Variable

- **Temperature**: Ambient air temperature (in degrees Celsius) recorded at each time point, serving as the primary focus for analysis and prediction. Temperature fluctuations over time reveal seasonal patterns, diurnal variations, and the influence of various weather phenomena. The temperature is classified according to the ideal range for wheat growth, which is between 12 and 25 degrees Celsius.

This dataset provides a detailed temporal record of key meteorological parameters, suitable for various analyses including time-series forecasting, trend analysis, and environmental monitoring.


# Insight and Recomendation
**Based on the prediction results indicating that the periods of April-June 2017 and October-December 2016 are ideal and favorable times for wheat planting, the following suggestions can be implemented to maximize wheat farming yields:**

**April-June 2017:**
- Begin preparing the land and seeds in March to be ready for planting in early April.
- Ensure that the soil is well-fertilized and properly tilled for optimal results.

**October-December 2016:**
- Start preparing the land and seeds as early as September. Ensure the irrigation system is ready to address potential water shortages during the initial planting phase.
- Prepare a backup water source, such as wells or ponds, to anticipate drought conditions in case of unexpected weather changes.
- Ensure Proper Drainage: Establish a good drainage system to prevent excessive waterlogging during heavy rains.
