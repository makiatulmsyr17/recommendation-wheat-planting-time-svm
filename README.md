# **Grow Gandum: Predicting Optimal Climate for Wheat Cultivation**

This project leverages machine learning to predict whether the weather and climate conditions are ideal for growing wheat, assisting farmers in making informed decisions and reducing the risk of crop failure.

## ** File Notebooks **

- **[Notebook](notebooks/)**: Explore data and develop predictive models.

## **Limitations**

- The climate data used in this project is sourced from non-Indonesian regions, which may limit the direct applicability to local farming conditions.

## **Disclaimer**

This project is intended as a demonstration of machine learning applications in climate and weather data analysis. The findings and predictions should be interpreted with caution, especially when applied to real-world agricultural scenarios.
