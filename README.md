# Meteorological Dataset Overview

This dataset is a comprehensive record of meteorological parameters over time, with a primary focus on temperature fluctuations. The dataset is organized as time-series data, with each data point corresponding to a specific date and time. The main target variable is the temperature, representing the ambient air temperature recorded periodically.

## Data Understanding

We are using Dataset 4, which records comprehensive meteorological parameters over time. The dataset consists of 64,320 rows with records taken every 15 minutes from 2016 to 2018. The available features in this dataset are:

- **Date**: Timestamp for each data point.
- **Iws**: Cumulative wind speed.
- **Ir**: Rainfall intensity.
- **Pm2.5**: Concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air.
- **PRES**: Atmospheric pressure recorded at each timestamp.
- **Cbwd**: Combined wind direction.
- **DEWP**: Dew point temperature.

This dataset provides a detailed temporal record of key meteorological parameters, suitable for various analyses including time-series forecasting, trend analysis, and environmental monitoring.
